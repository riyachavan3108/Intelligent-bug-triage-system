Intelligent Bug Triage System

The Intelligent Bug Triage System is an AI-based application designed to automatically classify, prioritize, and assign software bug reports to the appropriate developers. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the system analyzes bug descriptions and predicts the most suitable category or developer, reducing manual effort and improving issue resolution time.

The system processes unstructured bug reports using text preprocessing, feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF or embeddings, and trained classification models to provide accurate and efficient bug assignment.
